# CQF-Project--CDS-Pricing
Final report, code, and data related to my final project submission for the CQF course
The project involved pricing a basket of 5 CDSs using both the Gaussian Copula and t-Copula techniques. I have chosen 5 US technology/e-commerce companis as the reference names. I have scored 92% in the final project.
